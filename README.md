# FDF
## The first graphical project!
This project is about creating a simple wireframe model representation of a 3D land- scape by connecting various points (x, y, z) with lines.

The program has to represent the model in isometric projection for the mandatoru part.
The coordinates of the landscape are stored in a .fdf file passed as a parameter to your program. Here is an example:
```

Each number represents a point in space:
- The horizontal position corresponds to its axis.
- The vertical position corresponds to its ordinate.
- The value corresponds to its altitude.
